as a developer allow me to build games off of health hero's API

this game dev and his team would like to build some games off our api, they would get NFT(s) and get to keep the IP of the games

we need to build our API and create the endpoint necessary for developers to do this.

as it says above they would get NFT(s) and get to keep the IP of the games

endpoints all gamification needed to enable a game dev to build simple games: steps, xp, hp, levels, life, & star power to start

---- Technical Requirements -----
using Node js
Allow developers to set up the database for their game
Allow setup of the Hp/Xp/Levels/Life/Stars powers logic
Generate XP/Hp/Levels/Life/Stars based on data


Type of games (battle game, play to earn game, card game)

Schema Game: type_of_game (types of games will have another static schema),

Based on the type of game selected the relevant categories of schemas will be used 

For example for battle game a game character will have properties like lives, power,
attack, defense etc

For card games there will be a deck of card to be played with

game character will have different properties based on the game type

Main Collections
game (_id, game_type)
character (_id, game_id, player_id)
player (_id, name, email)
battle_chracter (_id, character_id, power, attack, defense, life)
play_to_earn_char (_id, character_id, balance)


Concept (play to earn games) ==> each player will have points
Steps
1) Select the type of the game (e.g battle game)
2) Build the game character (power, life, attack, defense)
3) Battle against other characters (this will continously update the properties of the chracter based on the interaction)


Endpoints Needed
1) Get all Characters a player currently has (merge for apis needed)
2) Access levels might be neede later on


Building game logics

Type of game (battle game)
Define character properties (xp, hp, power, life etc) => properties of the chracter will be defined in the schema based on the game type selected
so properties of the chracter will be array of objects
interactions will be defined on the frontend?

Game logics
Attack 
Defend
Life


Battle games types
Single player or multi player

single player games
attack bots 
avoid hurdles


Multiplayer
attack other character / breed on other characters



How to define game logics using schemas
Characters 
enemies (select enemy for the game => wide range of enemies with different powers and movement will be availbale)
Hurdles (define hurdles for the game => different hurdles will be available to choose from)
Game plaform (select a platform from a range of platforms)


Define a space for the game
Define levels for the games (based on the enemy powers)
Define all possible hurdles
Define enemies with the possible properties and powers, weapons and rarities, movements
Define characters with possible abilities, life , powers and movments, weapons
