1) Smart Contract Development and Testing for basic game functions (~2 days)
2) Improving on the api endpoints and adding additional routes needed (~2 days)
3) Integration of the smart contract with the api (~1-2 days)

This will include the initial structure of the game and the possible interactions with the blockchain using the smart contract functions. I will keep on improving the functionalities.

Possible roadblocks
1) High level requirements for the game required
2) High level structure of the game required
3) Relevant Samples required
